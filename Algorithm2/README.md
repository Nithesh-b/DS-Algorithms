Problem Statement:
Every object in the world has some stress related to it. Residual stresses are the ones which occur on a material even if it isnâ€™t loaded with anything. These stresses are derived by photo elasticity. To measure the stress on the material, we need to dig into the object. At certain depth, there is minimum and maximum pressure getting applied. The following table shows the same.
Fit best regression model on the given training data by minimizing the corresponding error function. You should solve this minimization problem by finding the stationery point of error function (or by equating first derivative of the function to zero).
Also predict the Min pressure which will be required at 3.8 mm depth.
